    <h1>Terms and condition</h1>
    <p>
        The Terms & Conditions agreement is the most important legal agreement a SaaS business needs: it's the legally binding agreement between the SaaS company and the customers accessing and using the app on a regular basis.

You can think of the Terms and Conditions as a legal contract that the SaaS business and its customers are signing together: the terms and rules as set in the agreement will govern the access of the service provided by the business.

Here's why you'll want a Terms and Conditions agreement if you're developing a SaaS app:

Rules around payments, subscriptions, cancellations and refunds
Rules around content that users create or post through the account even if it's private (user generated content)
Rules around termination of accounts (i.e. abusive accounts)
And much more
